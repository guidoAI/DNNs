    "The goal of learning is not only to perform well on the data that is used for training, but to also perform well on data that has not yet been seen by the learning algorithm. If a neural network is able to also make good predictions for unseen data, then it is said to \"generalize\" well. As stated earlier, the deeper a neural network is, the more representative power it has. The advantage of this is that a deeper neural network can learn more complex functions. The disadvantage is that it can adjust itself to noise in the input data. This problem is aggravated when little data is available for training.\n",

    "One way to prevent neural networks to overfit on the training data, is to divide the samples in a \"training set\" and a \"validation set\". The training set is used for adapting the weights with backpropagation, minimizing the error on the training samples. Each epoch the neural network is also applied to the validation set. When the network starts to overfit on the training data at the cost of generalization, the loss on the validation set will start to increase. The error on the validation set is not used for adapting the weights, but for determining when to stop training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a set of data samples, there is typically an additional \"test set\", which is not used during training at all. The loss on this test set can be reported to illustrate the true generalization performance. Of course, as soon as a Machine Learning practitioner uses the test set to adapt parameters of the learning algorithm, the test set has actually played a role in training. Then it looses its role as an independent test of the learned network.\n",

    "## Ensemble learning\n",
    "A well-proven method of increasing generalization and robustness is to use <i>ensembles</i> of neural networks. In ensemble learning, a group of neural networks is trained on different parts of the training set (see below for NN1-3). \n",
    "\n",
    "<IMG SRC=\"ensemble_training_set.png\" WIDTH=\"200px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the different networks train on different parts of the training data, they may give different outcomes for the same input sample, i.e., it can be that $\\hat{y}_i \\neq \\hat{y}_j$, $i \\neq j$ (see below). This allows for voting in classification problems or averaging in regression problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "<IMG SRC=\"ensemble_prediction.png\" WIDTH=\"200px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble learning has two main advantages. First, even though individual networks may overfit on their part of the training data, using an ensemble of networks will reduce the influence overfitting has on the final outcome. In other words, the hope of ensemble learning lies in a \"wisdom of the crowd\". Second, having multiple outputs for the same input sample also allows for evaluating <i>uncertainty</i>, e.g., by looking at the variance of the individual network outputs. Knowing how much to trust a given output can be very important for many applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "It also has a distinct disadvantage: Ensemble learning costs more time not only for training, but also for execution during inference time. This may be prohibitive for, e.g., embedded applications such as autonomous robots that rely on limited, onboard processors.<BR><BR>\n",

    "A new way to improve the robustness of learning and the generalization to unseen data is <i>dropout</i>. If dropout is used for a layer, neurons are set to zero with a given probability $p$. Normally, dropout is only used during training. When evaluating the trained network on test samples, dropout is then switched off. Of course, this means that at test time the activations will be higher. In order to compensate this, during training the outgoing weights of the layer are multiplied by $\\frac{1}{p}$. Suppose that $p=0.5$, during training on average $50\\%$ of the neurons are set to zero, while the weights are multiplied by 2. After training neurons will no longer be dropped out, and the weights will no longer be scaled. To make this happen, in PyTorch the neural network model should be set to evaluation mode: ``model.eval()``. Else, dropout will remain active.\n",

For example, the average can be used as the single ensemble estimate. The variance can be used as an indication of prediction uncertainty.\n",

    "Measurements of neurons in cats' visual systems have shown that they have neurons that specialize in reacting to elementary patterns like oriented edges in a small area of the visual field. The spatial structure of the retina is maintained in these areas, i.e., they are retinotopic. So there are neurons over the whole field of view that react to specific patterns. Whereas some neurons react for example to an oriented edge of $\\sim 0^{\\circ}$, others react to and edge at $\\sim 20^{\\circ}$, etc. \n",

    "\n",
    ", where $g(t)$ is the kernel. The minus sign before $\\tau$ within the $g$ function means that the kernel is horizontally flipped. The reason for this lies in ascertaining commutativity, i.e., that $f*g = g*f$. For the use of convolution in neural network libraries, this property is not so important. \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, in most neural network libraries, what is called 'convolution' is actually <i>cross-correlation</i>, which is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(t) \\star g(t) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(\\tau) g(t+\\tau) d\\tau$\n",
    "\n",
    "And, discretized:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(t) \\star g(t) = \\sum_{i=-\\infty}^{\\infty} f(i) g(t+i)$\n",

    "with $I$ for example a 2D image (e.g., $1280 \\times 1024$ pixels) and $K$ a small kernel (e.g., $5 \\times 5$ pixels). The kernel values are 'weight' parameters of the convolutional neural network. Since these weights do not change with position when convolving the entire image with the kernel, this is referred to as 'weight sharing'. This highlights the contrast with a fully connected network that would have a weight from each input pixel to each hidden neuron. One of the reasons behind the success of convolutional neural networks is that this weight sharing drastically reduces the number of parameters that have to be learned. Imagine that a single hidden neuron fully connected to the input image would already require $1280 \\times 1024 = 1,310,720$ weights, whereas a single kernel of $5 \\times 5$ pixels only requires $25$ weights... It will give a response over the entire image, thus determining the activations of $1280 \\times 1024$ hidden neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, when an image is in color and has three channels it can be convolved with 3D-kernels (e.g., $5 \\times 5 \\times 3$ pixels). Convolving a $1280 \\times 1024 \\times 3$ image with $n$ such 3D feature kernels while keeping the original image size will result in a hidden layer of dimensions $1280 \\times 1024 \\times n$. This itself can be convolved again with kernels of size, e.g., $3 \\times 3 \\times n$. Hence, by adding layers, you will get convolutions of convolutions of convolutions, and soforth. In this way a hierarchy of features is created, where the feature kernels represent ever more complex shapes when going deeper into the network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, typically, a convolutional layer is followed by a way of downsampling. An example of downsampling is <i>max-pooling</i>. In max-pooling, only the maximal value is retained in a region of interest, e.g., of size $2\\times2$. This reduces the size of the hidden layer, and increases the spatial scale of the features. Hence, at deeper layers in a convolutional neural network, features are not only more complex, but also of larger spatial scale. Finally, max-pooling also helps the network to deal with small translations, as the precise location in the region of interest does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For regression and classification tasks, it is common to <i>flatten</i> the last hidden layer. This means transforming the $M \\times N \\times O$ structured hidden layer to a one-dimensional vector of length $MNO$. This transformation preserves spatial information, as the order of values in the vector is related to their place in the hidden layer. However, this layer is typically connected to another hidden layer or output layer in a fully connected way. Hence, the neurons in the subsequent layer can combine information from any location in the image. A very simple convolutional neural network is shown below.<BR><BR>\n",

    "\n",
    "Fully convolutional networks are networks that first use convolutions to extract features and subsequently use deconvolutions (or transposed convolutions) in order to get back to the original input size. Typically, fully convolutional neural networks are used to map an image to an image-sized output, such as an image segmentation or even just a reconstruction of the input image. Concerning this latter case, it may initially seem strange to train a network to reconstruct the input image from the input image. However, the convolutional part of the network results in a low number of hidden neurons in the middle of the fully convolutional network that <i>encode</i> for the inputs. Hence, the activations of the hidden neurons form a compressed <i>latent space</i> representation of the image, which can be used for other purposes. For instance, in robotics, this latent space can be used for reinforcement learning.\n",

    "In this example, tiny learning rates (e.g., $10^{-4}$) will stay close to the initial point. Small learning rates (e.g., $10^-2$) will lead to a nice convergence. Large learning rates like $0.9$ will continuously overshoot the optimum but still converge eventually. A learning rate of $1$ represents a bifurcation point to diverging learning results - itself resulting in ever the same parameters on both sides of the optimum. At larger learning rates, the parameters will diverge.\n",

Whereas the initial image is $28 \\times 28 \\times 1$ pixels, after one convolution and max-pool, the resulting tensor has size $14 \\times 14 \\times 16$, and after our second convolution and max-pool $7 \\times 7 \\times 16 = 784$ neurons. Please remark that this is due to our settings, namely ``padding = 'same'`` and ``stride=2``. \n",
